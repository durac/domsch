This is my first-ever blog post and hopefully not the last :) I just set up this site with GatsbyJS and am completely amazed how easy it was. 

The purpose of this website is to share/note some of my daily light-bulb moments and generally things I'll learn in my life and during my work as a software developer.
I'm super excited about this since it is something I have on my todo list for quite some time, but never managed to actually tackle. 

See you soon!
